                <p><a href = "https://www.webmd.com/diabetes/default.htm">Diabetes</a> is a group of diseases which is marked by the body's inability to produce sufficient amounts, or to respond appropriately to insulin. It is not curable but it is highly treatable. Diabetes types 1 and 2 are the <a href = "https://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/volumes/67/wr/mm6712a2.htm">most common types of diabetes</a>. <a href = "https://www.joslin.org/the-problem-of-not-enough-beta-cells-in-type-1-dabetes.html">Type 1</a> patients need insulin for survival because their immune systems are are destroying their pancreas beta cells (those that produce insulin). Type 2 patients exhibit <a href = "http://www.diabetesforecast.org/2011/jun/understanding-insulin-resistance.html">"insulin resistance"</a> or <a href = "http://clinchem.aaccjnls.org/content/45/8/1339">"relative insulin deficiency"</a>. <a href = "https://www.cdc.gov/obesity/childhood/defining.html">Obesity</a> in children, on the other hand, is defined by the Centres for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) as the 95th percentile or greater of the body mass index (BMI) distribution of children of the same age and sex.</p>
                <p>Is there a relationship between childhood obesity and adult diabetes?</p> 
                <p>Data was extracted from two dataset provided by the CDC: (1) on <a href = "https://catalog.data.gov/dataset/u-s-chronic-disease-indicators-cdi">chronic disease indicators in the US</a> and (2) on <a href = "https://catalog.data.gov/dataset/nutrition-physical-activity-and-obesity-women-infant-and-child-dfe5d/resource/415dca15-b90a-46c3-8d13-70322ee4628e">nutrition, physical activity, and obesity in women, infants, and children</a>. The data was then transformed to show overall crude prevalence of diabetes in adults 18 years old and above and overall prevalence of obesity for children 2 to 4 years old. The time covered was 2012 and 2014, common for both data sources. The obesity and the diabetes data were loaded into a MySQL database as separate tables, and then merged. </p>

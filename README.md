# ETL of 2012 and 2014 data on adult diabetes and childhood obesity from the Centres for Disease Control and Prevention

## Introduction

## Methodology
A total of three Jupyter notebooks were used for extracting, transforming, and loading the diabetes and obesity data:

1. [Clean_Chronic_Disease_indicators.ipynb](https://github.com/rochiecuevas/diabetes/blob/master/Clean_Chronic_Disease_indicators.ipynb)
2. [Clean_Nutrition_Data.ipynb](https://github.com/rochiecuevas/diabetes/blob/master/Clean_Nutrition_Data.ipynb)
3. [Join_obesity_diabetes_tables.ipynb](https://github.com/rochiecuevas/diabetes/blob/master/Join_obesity_diabetes_tables.ipynb)

In addition, the MySQL database __diabetes_db__ was created using the [Diabetes.sql](https://github.com/rochiecuevas/diabetes/blob/master/Diabetes.sql) script. On the other hand, a Flask app ([diabetes_app.py](https://github.com/rochiecuevas/diabetes/blob/master/diabetes_app.py)) was developed to display the table and plots generated from the data onto html. This app is not yet online and currently lives on the localhost upon download. 

### Extract data
Data was extracted from two datasets provided by the CDC: (1) on [chronic disease indicators](https://catalog.data.gov/dataset/u-s-chronic-disease-indicators-cdi) in the U.S.A. and (2) on [nutrition, physical activity, and obesity in women, infants, and children](https://catalog.data.gov/dataset/nutrition-physical-activity-and-obesity-women-infant-and-child-dfe5d/resource/415dca15-b90a-46c3-8d13-70322ee4628e).

Both datasets were downloaded as csv files and extracted using Python (version 3.6) [Pandas](https://pandas.pydata.org/pandas-docs/stable/) module. The [chronic diseases indicators](https://drive.google.com/open?id=1QLxhiRwirRHE_AO_6p53Yv1QJ0Ei1K2f) file contains the statistics for __diabetes__ prevalence in adults 18+ years old. On the other hand, the data for occurrence of __obesity__ in children 2â€“4 years old are found in the [nutrition, physical activity, and obesity](https://drive.google.com/open?id=1lzKsXYhbfvTQ_lWLI_8ejOAeVgkvMt59) file. 



### Transform data
#### Chronic disease indicators (CDI) in the U.S.A.


#### Obesity statistics in women, infants, and children (WIC)

### Load data
